  <p> My name is Melissa Rojas(Meli)and I'm a senior at SAHS. This computer science essentials is the first project Lead the way course I've enrolled in. Despite being on the struggle bus first semester, my determination and imagination in this class has grown. Other STEM courses I am enrolled in is AP Physics and  AP Calculus. In the future I hope to pursue a career in dentistry to serve low-income families. As far as my hobbies, I love enjoying my free time listening to country music, hiking and painting.

    <td id="CSE"> I decided to enroll in Computer Science Essentials because I became interested in coding and understnading the deveoplemt od websites. CSE seemed like a great opportunity to learn more about coding and how those skills can translate in a working/school environment. I will continue on the PLTW pathway this semester at SAHS because it will give me a jumpstart to what I may learn in college and advance my tech skills. </td>
